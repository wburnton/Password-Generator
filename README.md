# Password-Generator

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

For this assignment, we were required to create a password generator that would display a randomly created password that fit within the set confines. A password must be between 8 and 128 characters, and also have numbers, upper and lowercase letters, and special characters as options. This was all done on creating new code on Javscript, utilizing a combination of window alerts and prompts, if statements, for loops, and math.random. 

This proved to be quite a challenge. Building the Javascript code up could be quite frustrating, as an intended result often wouldn't. Persistance was key here! I had some ups and downs making this, but I'm glad it's done because I learned a lot on how Javascript works as a result. 



 

## Usage
Use the generate button, then follow the prompts and input the length as they appear. The new password will appear in the bar below
